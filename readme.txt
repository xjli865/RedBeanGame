I want to create a game where the player needs to find a right time to
throw a moving ball towards three moving objects. The more objects the 
ball hits, more points are gained by the player.

1. Minimum features needed for the game:
   a. create three ellipses moving in x-direction at different speed.
   b. print the number of points inside each ellipse
   c. create a ball moving in x-direction and can be released when 
      a button is pressed
   d. create a button that will trigger the ball moving up so that it 
      can hit the moving objectives
   e. count which objective is hit by ball and caluclate total points

2. improvements I can make:
   a. assign a theme to the game. 
      (1). change three moving objectives to be three moving bowls
      (2). change the ball to be a red bean 
      (3). create a spoon to carry the red bean 
   b. create a message winodw before game started 
   c. ask player if they want to play again 

3. How to play to game:
   To get points, you would need to try you best to hit maximum number 
   of bowls with a red bean. To throw the red bean in the spoon, you 
   need to move your mouse to the grean 'Go' region. You only have one 
   chance for this game. Your total score will be shown when game is 
   finished. You can choose to play again if you like.
